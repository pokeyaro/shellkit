Build System

Breaking: Upgraded cibuildwheel from v2.19.2 to v3.0 for modern Python support
Added Python 3.13 support across all platforms (macOS, Linux)
Added Linux ARM64 (aarch64) architecture support for better Raspberry Pi and AWS Graviton compatibility
Simplified build matrix to reduce CI overhead while maintaining platform coverage

## [0.1.0-beta6] - 2025-06-26

### Changed
- **Breaking**: Restructured package layout to follow Python standards
- Moved all modules under unified `shellkit` package namespace
- Updated import paths: `from shell import *` â†’ `from shellkit.shell import *`
- Fixed scattered package installation in site-packages

### Fixed
- Resolved package structure causing modules to install as separate top-level packages
- Updated all internal import statements to use new package structure
- Fixed Makefile paths for new directory layout
- Corrected file path resolution in metadata and copyright modules
- Standardized import statement ordering throughout codebase

### Technical
- Package now installs as single `shellkit/` directory instead of scattered modules
- Maintains backward compatibility through proper package structure
- All entry points and CLI commands remain unchanged
- Implemented consistent import ordering: standard library â†’ project modules â†’ relative imports
- Updated build system to target macOS 14.0+ for better compatibility

### Development
- Established import style guide for consistent code organization
- Fixed cross-platform compilation warnings
- Improved package discovery and shared library detection


## [0.1.0-beta5] - 2025-06-26

### Fixed
- **Linux**: Fixed automatic detection of compiled shared library files
- Resolved `syslib.so` vs `syslib.cpython-311-x86_64-linux-gnu.so` filename mismatch


## [0.1.0-beta4] - 2025-06-26

### Fixed
- **Linux**: Fixed exit command hanging and creating zombie processes
- Replaced SYS_exit with SYS_exit_group for proper multi-threaded process termination
- Exit command now works correctly across all supported platforms


## [0.1.0-beta3] - 2025-06-25

### Added
- Python 3.13 support
- Multi-platform wheel building (Linux, macOS Intel/ARM)

### Changed
- Improved CI/CD pipeline with cross-platform testing


## [0.1.0-beta2] - 2025-06-25

### Fixed
- C extension build configuration for proper wheel packaging


## [0.1.0-beta1] - 2025-06-24

### âœ¨ Added

- Initial release of **ShellKit**, with two main submodules:
  - `libc`: A Python-based simulation of core C standard library functions, including `printf`, `write`, and `exit`.
  - `pysh`: A REPL-based interactive shell built on top of `libc`.
- Implemented essential built-in commands: `cd`, `echo`, `pwd`, `export`, `env`, `clear`, etc.
- Multilingual manual support: Chinese, English, Japanese, Korean.
- Advanced startup flags:
  - `--debug`, `--safe`, `--trace-echo`, `--thinking`.
- Customizable prompt styles with ANSI color and path format support.
- Cross-platform native syscall bridge (`syslib.so`) for:
  - macOS/Linux
  - x86_64 and ARM64 architectures.
- Robust `Makefile` workflow:
  - `make test`, `make check`, `make build`.
- Integrated unit test framework (`pytest`) and benchmark scripts.
- Preliminary GitHub Actions CI setup for linting, formatting, typing, and testing.
